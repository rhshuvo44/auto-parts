          <p className="text-xl">We are leading tools manufacturer. We have a market share of 40%. We are very selective of which tools to sell in where and where not. That is the reason we are not exposed to the European economies. But if you want to develop a European business and you want to sell into Europe, yes, you have to be there. When I look at the results for Europe, they are struggling. They have some good -- they have good OEM growth, but it's hard to find growth in the channel and there is not a whole lot in that channel because you don't have a very big range, if I could make a few comments about that.

We were first in China. We've seen tremendous growth in China. And so what do I do, and they said to me and they did it and they got great press coverage, which was great for the company, which is a little embarrassing for me, was, okay, we'll go to China. So we would send our sales reps, we would send our regional managers, we would send our directors, we would send our distributor sales reps to China.</p>
